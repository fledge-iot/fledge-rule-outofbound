===========================================
Fledge OutOfBound notification rule plugin
===========================================

A simple notification rule plugin:

Rule specific default configuration

The "rule_config" property is a JSON object with a "rules" array:

Example:
[
    {
      "asset": {
        "description": "The asset name for which notifications will be generated.",
        "name": "flow"
      },
      "datapoints": [
        {
          "type": "float",
          "trigger_value": 101.3,
          "name": "random"
        }
      ],
      "evaluation_type": {
        "options": [
          "window",
          "maximum",
          "minimum",
          "average"
        ],
        "type": "enumeration",
        "description": "Rule evaluation type",
        "value": "latest"
      },
      "eval_all_datapoints": true
    },
    {
      ...
    }
]

If the array size is greater than one, each asset with datapoint(s) is evaluated.
If all assets evaluations are true, then the notification is sent.


Build
-----
To build Fledge "OutOfBound" notification rule C++ plugin,
in addition fo Fledge source code, the Notification server C++
header files are required (no .cpp files or libraries needed so far)

The path with Notification server C++ header files cab be specified only via
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_INCLUDE_DIRS environment variable.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

  $ export NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/ubuntu/source/fledge-service-notification/C/services/notification/include

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

- By default the Fledge develop package header files and libraries
  are expected to be located in /usr/include/fledge and /usr/lib/fledge
- If **FLEDGE_ROOT** env var is set and no -D options are set,
  the header files and libraries paths are pulled from the ones under the
  FLEDGE_ROOT directory.
  Please note that you must first run 'make' in the FLEDGE_ROOT directory.

You may also pass one or more of the following options to cmake to override 
this default behaviour:

- **FLEDGE_SRC** sets the path of a Fledge source tree
- **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** sets the path to Fledge header files
- **FLEDGE_LIB sets** the path to Fledge libraries
- **FLEDGE_INSTALL** sets the installation path of Random plugin

NOTE:
 - The **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** option should point to a location where all the Fledge 
   header files have been installed in a single directory.
 - The **FLEDGE_LIB** option should point to a location where all the Fledge
   libraries have been installed in a single directory.
 - 'make install' target is defined only when **FLEDGE_INSTALL** is set

Examples:

- no options

  $ cmake ..

- no options and FLEDGE_ROOT set

  $ export FLEDGE_ROOT=/some_fledge_setup

  $ cmake ..

- set FLEDGE_SRC

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_SRC=/home/source/develop/Fledge  ..

- set FLEDGE_INCLUDE

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INCLUDE=/dev-package/include ..
- set FLEDGE_LIB

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_LIB=/home/dev/package/lib ..
- set FLEDGE_INSTALL

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/home/source/develop/Fledge ..

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/usr/local/fledge ..
